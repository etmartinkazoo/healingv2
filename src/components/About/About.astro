				<p>
					Healing Earth Design was founded on the belief that caring for the land can be a
					powerful form of healing. After experiencing personal loss, I returned to school for
					sustainable horticulture and landscape design, finding peace and purpose through
					working with plants, soil, and seasonal rhythms. What began as a way to heal grew
					into a calling to help others reconnect with the earth in meaningful, practical ways.
