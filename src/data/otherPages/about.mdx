## About Healing Earth Design

Healing Earth Design was founded on the belief that caring for the land can be a powerful form of healing.

After experiencing personal loss, I returned to school for sustainable horticulture and landscape design, finding peace and purpose through working with plants, soil, and seasonal rhythms. What began as a way to heal grew into a calling to help others reconnect with the earth in meaningful, practical ways.

## Who I Am

I'm Sarah Martin, a sustainable horticulture and landscape design graduate with over five years of hands-on gardening experience. My yard serves as a trial garden where I test plants, observe ecosystems, and refine designs before bringing ideas to clients.

I specialize in plant-forward design—no hardscapes, no unnecessary complexity—just thoughtful, site-appropriate plantings that are beautiful, resilient, and supportive of local ecosystems.

## My Approach

I believe in "right plant, right place." Every design begins with listening—to the land, to the client, and to what will thrive long-term.

Whether you're a beginner gardener or someone looking to deepen your connection to your outdoor space, I meet you where you are and help you grow with confidence.
