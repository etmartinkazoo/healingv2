goal: "To enhance a lakefront home with seasonal color through annual plantings that complemented the surrounding landscape and remained easy to maintain."
challenges: "Wind exposure and fluctuating lakefront conditions. Containers requiring frequent watering. Desire for a cohesive look across multiple pots and window boxes."
solution: "I designed coordinated annual plantings using resilient, sun-tolerant plants arranged with a balance of focal, filler, and trailing species. Plant selections emphasized durability, texture, and color harmony while keeping care requirements realistic."
outcome: "The finished pots and window boxes provided vibrant color and movement throughout the season, enhancing the home's connection to the lake while remaining manageable for the homeowner."
