**Client Goal:** To enhance a lakefront home with seasonal color through annual plantings that complemented the surrounding landscape and remained easy to maintain.

**Challenges:** Wind exposure and fluctuating lakefront conditions. Containers requiring frequent watering. Desire for a cohesive look across multiple pots and window boxes.

**Solution:** I designed coordinated annual plantings using resilient, sun-tolerant plants arranged with a balance of focal, filler, and trailing species. Plant selections emphasized durability, texture, and color harmony while keeping care requirements realistic.

**Outcome:** The finished pots and window boxes provided vibrant color and movement throughout the season, enhancing the home's connection to the lake while remaining manageable for the homeowner.
