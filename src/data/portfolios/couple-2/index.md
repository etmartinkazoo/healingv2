**Client Goal:** To create a compact, functional herb garden that supports medicinal and culinary use while showcasing a variety of growing conditions in a small space.

**Challenges:** Limited footprint. Need for varied moisture and sun conditions. Desire for both beauty and practicality.

**Solution:** I designed and installed a traditional herb spiral, creating multiple microclimates within a single structure. Drought-tolerant herbs were placed higher on the spiral, while moisture-loving plants were positioned toward the base. Plant choices were guided by medicinal use, growth habits, and site conditions.

**Outcome:** The herb spiral became a highly productive and visually engaging garden feature, providing fresh medicinal and culinary herbs throughout the growing season while serving as an educational example of ecological garden design.
