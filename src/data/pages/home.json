    "body": "Healing Earth Design was founded on the belief that caring for the land can be a powerful form of healing. After experiencing personal loss, I returned to school for sustainable horticulture and landscape design, finding peace and purpose through working with plants, soil, and seasonal rhythms. What began as a way to heal grew into a calling to help others reconnect with the earth in meaningful, practical ways.",
